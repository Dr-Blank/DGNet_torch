This is the pytorch implementation of the paper "Deep Gradient Learning for Efficient Camouflaged Object Detection" by Ge-Peng Ji, Deng-Ping Fan, Yu-Cheng Chou, Dengxin Dai, Alexander Liniger, Luc Van Gool. The paper can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.12853).

This is modified to work with 2 new datasets:

* Military Camouflage Dataset (MCD)
* MoCA Video Dataset

`masking.py`:
   - creates mask for MoCA dataset and makes a video of the masked images
